# Proof of Work – Johnson & Johnson (Kyree Sullivan)

This repo demonstrates hands-on capability across **AI/ML engineering**, **Generative AI**, and **Discovery Statistics** aligned to three J&J roles.

## Projects
1. **MLOps Pipeline (Engineer)** – End-to-end training → API → Docker → CI.  
2. **GenAI Policy Assistant (Data Scientist)** – RAG with citations + eval harness.  
3. **Discovery Statistics (Senior Scientist)** – DOE, dose–response, ANOVA, CI.

## Quickstart
```bash
make setup
make test
```
